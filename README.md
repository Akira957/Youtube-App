This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Youtube-App

The purpose of this project is to extract data from Youtube's API. I will be making more projects like this in the furture.

# Motivation

I am on Youtube on a Consistent Basis. Always have wondered what it would be like to extract Youtube's data

# Features

This is in React.js Javascript, as well with Node.js npm packages that include the following dependencies. Axios is the most important because it is responsible for grabbing my API key. Dotenv is used a hide my API key to make sure that know one sees my key, and @material-ui/core for the organization and spacing for the app.

# API Reference

This is only using Google API Youtube version 3. Here is the link to the google API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/

# How to use

Think of this as a small version of Youtube. The search bar above allows you to search for YouTube videos. The word you type in the search bar are at the first five videos in the search. Then play the video just like you would play a video on Youtube.
